jquery recurranceinput widget
=============================

Jquery plugin widget which support the definition of complex recurrence
rulesets based on RFC2445, the iCalendar standard.

The recurrence rule string, generated by this package, should be directly usable
in ics calendar files. It was developed for the plone.event PLIP10886 and is
used there to define python-dateutil rrulestr instances.


TODO
----

High priority:

* Tests.
* All [INPUTx] should be fixed. (Possibly use gettext.js?)
* Prettify the CSS.
* There should be a human-readable printout of the rule, ie 
  "Repeats every second week on thursdays for five times until 2/12/2012."
  This should replace the "Does not repeat" text.
* We need parameters to specify start and end widgets.
* When start widget is specified, the day of month and similar parameters
  should be automatically calculated, filled in and made read only.

Medium priority:

* We need to be able to display the occurrences in the widget.
  This will likely a callback JSON API (or we need to do rrule iteration in JS).
* Occurrences should be able to be "skipped" (by using EXDATE).
* User should be able to add occurrences (RDATE).
* Make more examples in the demo.html: i18n, templates etc.

Low priority:

* The X next occurrences + the last occurrence could be displayed when
  editing the rule.
