jquery recurranceinput widget
=============================

Jquery plugin widget which support the definition of complex recurrence
rulesets based on RFC2445, the iCalendar standard.

The recurrence rule string, generated by this package, should be directly usable
in ics calendar files. It was developed for the plone.event PLIP10886 and is
used there to define python-dateutil rrulestr instances.


TODO:

High priority:

* Should load rule from box when opening.
* Cancel should close without modifying
* Unchecking should empty textarea.
* All [INPUTx] should be fixed.
* Parsing/Generating should include all fields.
* Prettify the CSS.
* There should be a human-readable printout of the rule.

Medium priority:

* Support for recurrence "templates" that are selectable (see mockup).
* We need to be able to display the occurrences in the widget.
* Occurrences should be able to be "skipped" (by using EXDATE).
* User should be able to add occurrences (RDATE).

Low priority:

* The X next occurrences + the last occurrence could be displayed when
  editing the rule.
