jquery recurranceinput widget
=============================

Jquery plugin widget which support the definition of complex recurrence
rulesets based on RFC2445, the iCalendar standard.

The recurrence rule string, generated by this package, should be directly usable
in ics calendar files. It was developed for the plone.event PLIP10886 and is
used there to define python-dateutil rrulestr instances.


TODO
----

High priority:

* We need parameters to specify start and end widgets.
* When start widget is specified, the day of month and similar parameters
  should be automatically calculated, filled in and made read only.
* Make more examples in the demo.html: i18n, templates etc.
* Coverage running, and extend tests to 100%.

Medium priority:

* We need to be able to display the occurrences in the widget.
  This will likely a callback JSON API (or we need to do rrule iteration in JS).
* Occurrences should be able to be "skipped" (EXDATE). This should be
  implemented by having a trashcan or (x) button besides the occurrences.
* User should be able to add occurrences (RDATE) with an "Add..." link close
  to the list of occurrences.

Low priority:

* The X next occurrences + the last occurrence could be displayed in the
  popup when editing the rule. 
* Support more obscure RFC options.
* The human readable output should probably be done directly from the RRULE and
  not by using the form i18n, to improve the grammar and rule support.
