jquery recurranceinput widget
=============================

Jquery plugin widget which support the definition of complex recurrence
rulesets based on RFC2445, the iCalendar standard.

The recurrence rule string, generated by this package, should be directly usable
in ics calendar files. It was developed for the plone.event PLIP10886 and is
used there to define python-dateutil rrulestr instances.


TODO:

High priority:

* Tests.
* All [INPUTx] should be fixed.
* Parsing/Generating should include all fields.
* Prettify the CSS.
* There should be a human-readable printout of the rule, ie 
  "Repeats every second week on thursdays for five times until 2/12/2012."
  This should replace the "Does not repeat" text.

Medium priority:

* Support for recurrence "templates" that are selectable (see mockup).
  Basically, if there are templates, the "Repeatse every day" label is replaced
  with a drop down showing the templates. The "Edit..." link creates and 
  selects a new rule with the human readable rule as title.
* We need to be able to display the occurrences in the widget.
* Occurrences should be able to be "skipped" (by using EXDATE).
* User should be able to add occurrences (RDATE).
* Make more examples in the demo.html: i18n, templates etc.

Low priority:

* The X next occurrences + the last occurrence could be displayed when
  editing the rule.
